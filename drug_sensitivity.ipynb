        "For this project, I decided I wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn about bioinformatics and pharmacology. I started by searching for a topic and dataset to base the project on, and I came across the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer ([GDSC](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/)) data repository. GDSC has collected data on hundreds of different drugs with measurements of their efficacy in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells (the GDSC data contains drug inihibition measurements for approximately 1000 cancer cell lines).\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking through the GDSC website, I soon realized that it would be too difficult for a non-expert like me to assemble a dataset for this project from \"scratch\". Fortunately, I found the [PyTDC](https://pypi.org/project/pytdc/) project (from the [Therapeutics Data Commons](https://tdcommons.ai/) group), which offers a packaged version of the GDSC raw data in a ready-to-use form for ML. Then all I had to do to access the GDSC data was to install the `PyTDC` library and import the dataframe into Pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the GDSC data in hand, as I started doing some EDA and transformations, I quickly found that my local machine, even with 32 GB of RAM, was not going to be up to the task of manipulating dataframes on the order of ~175,000 rows and ~20,000 columns. I thought about condensing the dataset into a randomly sampled subset, but I was concerned that this would hinder model performance. In the end, I decided to use a Google Colab environment with 171 GB RAM and an NVIDIA A100 GPU. This came with its own set of difficulties, but utimately Colab was able to support the compute needs for the project. This turned out to be a good lesson in the pitfalls of managing a \"large\" dataset.\n",

        "## Project Goal and Background Info\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that predicts a drug's efficacy at inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. We'll start by describing the data in the GDSC dataset to understand how the model can make its predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset is structured around drug/cell line pairings. Each row represents an experiment where a specific drug was tested on a particular cancer cell line*.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Input\n",
        "The model will use two main types of input data to make its predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Cell Line:** A large portion of each row in the dataset is dedicated to a cancer cell's **gene expression profile**. This profile is represented by approximately 17,000 columns, where each column corresponds to a specific gene. The value in each of these columns quantifies that gene's activity levelâ€”indicating whether it is more or less active (\"turned on\" or \"off\") in that particular cancer cell. Together, these columns provide a detailed molecular snapshot of the cancer cell for the model to learn from.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Drug:** For each row in the data, there is also sizeable number of columns dedicated to the **drug's molecular structure**. The molecular structure is first encoded in what is called a [SMILES (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Molecular_Input_Line_Entry_System) string. For inputing the drug's molecular data into the neural network, we convert the SMILES string into numerical form using a method called a [Morgan Fingerprint](https://darkomedin-datascience.medium.com/data-science-for-drug-discovery-research-morgan-fingerprints-using-alanine-and-testosterone-92a2c69dd765). This process transforms the chemical structure of each drug into a fixed-length vector of 0s and 1s (2048 bits long). Each position in the vector represents the presence or absence of specific chemical components. These 2048 fingerprint values become columns in the dataset, providing the model with a detailed numerical profile of the drug's chemical features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Output\n",
        "\n",
        "The model's target variable is the log of the measured **IC50 value** for each row's drug/cell line pairing. [IC50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50) is a standard measure of a drug's potency. It represents the concentration of a drug required to inhibit a biological process (such as cancer cell growth) by 50%. To determine this value, cell samples are exposed in a laboratory to varying concentrations of the drug. After an incubation period, [cell viability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viability_assay) is measured (often by measuring light intensity shone through the samples, which correlates with the number of living cells). A dose-response curve, typically a [4-parameter logistic curve](https://www.quantics.co.uk/blog/what-is-the-4pl-formula/), is then fitted to these measurements to calculate the IC50 value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the objective is to train a model that can take a cell line's gene expression profile and a drug's chemical structure as input and accurately predict the resulting IC50 value. This is a regression task in the output of the neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "*A cell line is a population of cancer cells that have been sampled from a patient and re-grown in a laboratory. Different cell lines can represent one type of cancer (for example, breast cancer), yet each cell line is genetically unique as it originates from one particular patient."

The clustering of predictions around certain values was a persistent issue across models except the last model, where batch normalization seems to provide some improvement. More tuning and experimentation would be necessary to discover further improvements.\n",

Potential future steps include investigating different model architectures (graph neural networks, etc.), trying other machine learning algorithms suited tabular data, and potentially incorporating additional biological and chemical features from the GDSC dataset."
